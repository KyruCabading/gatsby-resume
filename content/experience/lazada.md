### Lazada, Philippines | Sep, 2017 â€“ May, 2018

Managed growth of our affiliate partners. Automated outreach and onboarding for Lazada's Affiliate Partners under a CPA structure.

Created a Lazada Affiliate Program Chatbot to handle day-to-day questions and concerns of affiliates. This also helped triage affiliates to proper channels when required.

The result was that this chatbot removed admin load of our support channel by 1,000+ messages per month.
